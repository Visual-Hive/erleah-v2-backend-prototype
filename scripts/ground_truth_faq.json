    "question": "Meeting Request Process for Exhibitors? How do I accept a meeting request as an exhibitor? Will my team see meetings assigned to them? ",
    "answer": "When an attendee wants to meet with your company, they'll send a meeting request through Erleah. Here's how it works on your end:\nThe primary point of contact (POC) for your exhibitor profile will receive the meeting invitation first. They'll be able to see the attendee's details and any information about why they want to meet or what they're interested in.\nFrom there, the POC has the flexibility to decide who on the team should take the meeting. They can assign it to themselves or to any other team member who's registered under your exhibitor profile. Once they've selected the right person and confirmed the meeting details, the system locks it in.\nThe team member who's been assigned will then see the meeting appear in their personal schedule within Erleah on My Agenda page, along with all the relevant attendee information and context they need to prepare. This way, everyone knows who they're meeting with and when, without any back-and-forth coordination needed."

    "question": "\"How can I find a specific speaker?\", \"What session is Jane Doe speaking in?\", \"Show me Jane Doe's sessions\", \"Where can I find Jane Doe's talk?\", \"When is Jane Doe speaking?\"",
    "answer": "You can ask me directly for any speaker by name, and I’ll search the entire event program to find where and when they are speaking. For example, you can say “What session is Jane Doe speaking in?” or “Show me Jane Doe’s sessions,” and I’ll provide the session titles, times, and locations. If a speaker appears in more than one session, I’ll list them all so you can easily plan your schedule. You can also ask broader questions like “Who is speaking about sustainability?” or “Which sessions feature data analytics experts?” and I’ll identify the relevant speakers and sessions for you."
